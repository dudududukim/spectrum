CSS Grid has revolutionized how we create layouts on the web. Here are five pro tips that will make your Grid layouts more powerful and maintainable.

## 1. Use `grid-template-areas` for Semantic Layouts

Instead of positioning items by line numbers, use named grid areas for more readable code:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header"
    "sidebar main main"
    "footer footer footer";
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.header { grid-area: header; }
.sidebar { grid-area: sidebar; }
.main { grid-area: main; }
.footer { grid-area: footer; }
```

This approach makes your layout structure immediately clear and easier to modify.

## 2. Leverage `minmax()` for Responsive Columns

Create truly responsive grids without media queries:

```css
.responsive-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

This creates columns that are at least 300px wide but grow to fill available space. When there's not enough room, items wrap to the next row.

## 3. Use `subgrid` for Nested Grids (When Supported)

Subgrid allows child elements to participate in their parent's grid:

```css
.parent-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 1rem;
}

.child-item {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
  grid-column: span 3;
}
```

This ensures perfect alignment between parent and child grid items.

## 4. Combine Grid with Flexbox

Grid for the big picture, Flexbox for the details:

```css
.card-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}

.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.card-content {
  flex: 1; /* Pushes footer to bottom */
}
```

## 5. Use `dense` for Better Space Utilization

The `grid-auto-flow: dense` property fills gaps in your grid:

```css
.masonry-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  grid-auto-rows: 20px;
  grid-auto-flow: dense;
  gap: 1rem;
}

.item-tall { grid-row: span 3; }
.item-wide { grid-column: span 2; }
```

This creates a masonry-like layout where items fill available spaces efficiently.

## Bonus: Grid Debugging

Add this to your CSS during development to visualize your grid:

```css
.grid-container {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #ff0000 1px, transparent 1px),
              linear-gradient(to bottom, #ff0000 1px, transparent 1px);
  background-size: 20px 20px;
}
```

These tips will help you create more sophisticated and maintainable layouts with CSS Grid. The key is to combine Grid's powerful two-dimensional capabilities with other CSS features for the best results.
