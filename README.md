## Ruby 3.4.0+ Compatibility

This template includes compatibility fixes for Ruby 3.4.0 and later versions. Starting from Ruby 3.4.0, several standard library gems (csv, base64, bigdecimal, logger) are no longer included by default and must be explicitly added to the Gemfile.

The following gems are automatically included in this template:
- `csv` - For CSV file processing
- `base64` - For base64 encoding/decoding
- `bigdecimal` - For high-precision decimal arithmetic
- `logger` - For logging functionality

If you encounter any "cannot load such file" errors related to these libraries, make sure you've run `bundle install` after cloning the repository.
